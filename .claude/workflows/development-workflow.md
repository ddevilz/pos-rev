- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined

### Review Roles
- **Author**: Submits PR with detailed description
- **Reviewer**: Reviews code and provides feedback
- **Approver**: Final approval for merge
- **Tester**: Validates functionality

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# Component tests
npm run test:components

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
composer test

# Integration tests
composer test:integration

# API tests
composer test:api

# Coverage report
composer test:coverage
```

### Testing Guidelines
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies

## Environment Management

### Development Environment
- Local database instance
- Hot reloading enabled
- Debug mode enabled
- Detailed error messages
- Development middleware

### Staging Environment
- Production-like configuration
- Limited debug information
- Performance monitoring
- User acceptance testing
- Integration testing

### Production Environment
- Optimized builds
- Error logging only
- Security hardening
- Performance monitoring
- Backup systems

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **PHPStan**: PHP static analysis
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis
- **Husky**: Git hooks for quality checks

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Lint staged files
npm run lint:staged

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm run test:changed

# Format code
npm run format:staged
```
